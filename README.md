# Assignment 1 - Point3D Class and Strings
 
## Overview
In this assignment we declared a function in a class named `Point3D` in the `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h` file. The class is designed such that it  represents the point in three-dimensional space.

# Assignment 2: Character Functions

## Overview
This project includes a C++ function that returns a `std::string` with a message.

# Assignment3: File Handling in C++ Part1

## Overview

In this assignment we used file handling to read and process triangle data from a file. The implementation is split between two files: `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`. For this we used the `getline()` function, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects, and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects.

# Assignment4: File Handling in C++ Part2

## Overview
In this assignment we used file handling to read and process triangle data from a file. The implementation is split between two files: `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`. For this we used the `getline()` function, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects and to read only `vertex` value from .stl file.

# Assignment 5: Implementation of Lambda Function

## Overview

In this assignment, a lambda expression named `displayMsgFileNotFound` has been implemented in the `Reader.cpp` file. The purpose of this lambda expression is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

# Assignment 6: Implementation of Lambda Function with capture clause and mutable.

## Overview

In this assignment, a lambda expression named `displayMsgFileNotFound` has been implemented in the `Reader.cpp` file with capture clause and `mutable` keyword.The purpose of this lambda expression is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

# Assignment 7: Genralized capture with initialization

## Overview

In this assignment, a lambda expression named `displayMsgFileNotFound` has been implemented in the `Reader.cpp` file with `Genralized capture with initialization`.The purpose of this lambda expression is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.

# Assignment 8 - Implementation of Iterators.
 
## Overview
In this assignment we used iterators to print vertex points on the console. The task involves defining an iterator type for a vector of triangles and subsequently iterating through the vector to display the vertex coordinates.

# Assignment 9 - Implemetation of sequential containers List, Vector, Deque
 
## Overview
 
In this assignment we used sequential containers such as list, vector and deque.

# Assignment 10 - Implemetation of sequential container Deque Part2
 
## Overview
 
This assignment involves use of sequential container deque and string concatenation.

# Assignment 11 - Use of `std::map` Container in C++ STL
 
## Overview
 
This assignment focuses on the utilization of the `std::map` container in C++ STL. In the `/headers/Triangulation.h` file, a `std::map<Triangle, double> tArea` is declared to store pairs of `Triangle` objects and their areas. The container is populated using the `void Triangulation::setArea()` function. Additionally, two methods are available to retrieve and print the areas

# Assignment 12: Implementation of virtual function.
 
## Overview
 
In this assignment, implemented inheritance with virtual function.

# Assignment 13 - Implementation of Interfacing of C++ functions with C code.
## Overview
 
This assignment involves using **C** code to implement specific part of the program.
This is applicable for most of the languages just the keywords or the methods can be different.
The objective is to make the program faster by directly treating a part code as **C** program.
